# FILL: FInance Laboratory for Learning

This project is no longer under active development.

The ideas explored here are being consolidated into a broader execution research platform under [Substrate](https://github.com/hnaik/substrate). Future updates, tools, and research will live there.

If you are interested in execution systems, simulation, and market microstructure research, please follow progress at: [Substrate](https://github.com/hnaik/substrate)
